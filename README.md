# ObjectDetect

ObjectDetect is a modern Android app that lets users select an image from their gallery and performs cloud-based object detection using a Roboflow workflow. The app displays both the original and processed images (with bounding boxes), supports full-screen viewing with zoom/pan, and is built with Jetpack Compose, Ktor, and Koin using Clean Architecture.
